        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>This is a implementation of the game "4 in a row", where you play against the computer.
             The computer uses a search algorithm known as "Minimax", to find out which move to play. 
             It looks at all combinations of the next 9 moves, and evaluates the resulting boards, based on who is in a favourable position.
             If red is winning, it gives a negative score. If yellow is winning, it gives a positive score. If neither are winning, the score is 0.
             By disincentivizing moves which would lead to a loss, and incentivizing moves which give many opportunities for wins, it plays relatively well.
             You can see the final evaluation of the boardstate yellow was faced with under each column. 
             If you see a number greater than 0.9, you've likely already lost, maybe you just don't know it yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that while "4 in a row" is mathematically solved, and with perfect play red always wins in the last move of the game, 
             this computer is not perfect. Since it is only looking 9 moves deep, it uses a heuristic calculation to try to maximize winning positions.
             If you set up traps which will trigger in more than 9 turns, it is still possible to win, even without perfect play.
